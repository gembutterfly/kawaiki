Kawaiki Icon Theme


Hello, I am happy, that you found my Icon-Theme. I put lots of work into it. It's still far from perfect, but made great progress during the last year. I know, nowadays people like flat, tile-like icons with consistent looks. Consistency really matters, but I just wanted to create a beautiful icon theme which meets the criteria of being consistent, but still giving you unique beauty with great detail for your desktop. I hope you like it, as much as I do and don't hesitate to comment, if you have any problems with it ;)


Please take that one second to vote up, if you like my work :)


Thanks:
Go to all the artists out there, who inspired me with their beautiful works. Especially the creator of the Faenza and Faience Icon Themes, who brought us a new level of beauty on the linux desktop.
I also loved the Human Folder Icons in Ubuntu Jaunty and never understood, why they changed them.


README:
As long as this theme is not complete, you may find it much prettier, when using it together with tiheum's awesome Faenza-Icon-Theme. Just add it as "Inherits=" in the index.theme file.

Important! If you use this Icon-Theme with XFCE or LXDE, don't forget to add their standard-icon-themes in the "index.theme" file "inherits"-line.

e.g.: Xubuntu
- open "index.theme" in "Kawaiki-Only"
- add elementary-xfce after "Inherits="
